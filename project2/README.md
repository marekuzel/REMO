# Project 2: Rush Hour
Model the solitaire game Rush Hour and use
UPPAAL to solve the puzzle. The game is simple. You have a 6x6 board, and you find several vehicles of different sizes (cars and trucks) on the board. The game's goal is to move the
vehicles by driving forward and backwards so that the RED car can
leave the board at the exit on the right side of the board. The vehicles cannot turn!
